# How to use
Simply download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

<img width="525" height="233" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33e7f581-a5e3-4589-bb52-42a10148e9df" />

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

# Notes

This effect is made with Normal interface size. If you use a different one, you can resize all the elements at once by right-clicking on the pack and selecting resize. Alternatively, you can move the pack's position on screen if needed, though it should be aligned by default.

- Original UI concept by note tobi.7146.
